    <title> Working with text </title>
</head>
<body>
    <p> To create different paragraphs, enclose them with the opening p tag, and closing p tag</p>

    <h1> The first Heading</h1>
    <h2> The second Heading </h2>

    <p> The headings can be chosen from many different sizes, ranging from h1 to h6 </p>

    <h3> Different Text Manipulations </h3>

    <p> You can choose to enclose text within a strong tag, to make the text <strong> bold </strong>.
        You can choose to enclose text within an em tag, to make the text <em> italicised </em>. 

        <!-- Notice that code is often indented, and nested. This makes code 
        readable and presents a clear logical hierarchy.    -->


        <!-- ol stands for ordered list  -->
        <ol>   
            <li> Item 1 </li>
            <li> Item 2 </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3> Anchor Elements </h3>

    <p> An anchor Element can be used by adding an a tag. This tag should make a particular 
        bit of text clickable. Once given a href attribute, where the href attribute links 
        us to any particular place, we can click on text, and be transported to a given 
        destination. 

        There are further things that we add on besides the href, one of them is target="_blank",
        this tells the computer to open the image on a lank tab, otherwise the default is target="_self"
        Another one which is used is rel="noopener noreferrer", which states that the relation between 
        your page will be one where the noopener prevents the opened link from gaining access to the 
        webpage from which it is opened. The noreferrer value prevents the link from knowing which website
        has a reference to the link. These added measures are for security.
    </p>

    <h3> Images </h3>

    <p> The image element, is made of img tag. The img element takes in an attribute, of src. 
        This will take in the file path for a particular image that you might want to use.
